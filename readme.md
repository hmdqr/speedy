# Speedy

Speedy is a simple Python application for testing internet speed using the [speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/) service. It features a graphical user interface built with the wxPython library.

## Usage

To use Speedy, simply run the `speedtest_app.py` script:
`python speedtest_app.py`
Click the "Start" button to begin the speed test, and click the "Cancel" button to stop the test. 
The test results will be displayed in the application window .

## Accessibility

Speedy is designed to be accessible to all users, including those who use screen readers. 
However, as a blind developer, I am still learning pywx and I recognize that the current implementation may not be optimal for screen reader users. 
I am working to improve accessibility and ensure that all controls are accessible and properly labeled. 
In the meantime, you can use the NVDA navigator cursor to interact with the application.

Please note that I am working on this project solo and it may take some time to improve the accessibility of the application. 
However, any feedback is appreciated .
